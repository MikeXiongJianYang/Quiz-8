#Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
For the upcoming project, I intende to do mosaic art, I find inspiration in the technique used in Chuck Close's incredible portrait paintings. Close's artwork relies on grids of small, meticulously crafted squares, each with unique colors and shading. I'm particularly drawn to how he captures intricate details and emotions by piecing together these tiny elements.  Our challenge is to represent a chosen artwork through code, and mosaic art is an effective way to do this. By breaking down the original artwork into smaller squares, we can use the tools and techniques we've learned to capture the essence of the artwork, whether it's defined by distinct lines or geometric patterns. This approach allows us to create a code-based representation that respects the characteristics of the chosen artwork. Here are two screenshots of Chuck Close's artwork in the file name as Chuck Close1, Chuck Close2.

The pixel manipulation coding technique demonstrated in the provided p5.js example is highly relevant to achieving the desired mosaic effect for the group project. It enables precise control over individual pixels, allowing us to determine the color and placement of each pixel, aligning perfectly with the intricacies of mosaic art.

In the code example, the use of the random() function to decide both the shapes and colors of each square, as well as the strategic placement of disired image, serves as a tangible demonstration of how pixel-level control can yield captivating mosaic patterns. We can directly apply this technique to our group project by meticulously analyzing the pixels of the chosen artwork and replacing them with squares of varying colors, resulting in a code-based mosaic that faithfully represents the original artwork while offering creative flexibility.
